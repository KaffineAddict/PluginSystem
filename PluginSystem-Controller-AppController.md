PluginSystem\Controller\AppController
===============

Class AppController




* Class name: AppController
* Namespace: PluginSystem\Controller
* Parent class: Cake\Controller\Controller







Methods
-------


### initialize

    void PluginSystem\Controller\AppController::initialize()

Initialization hook method.

This function is not needed as we do not at this time have any initialization needed for the plugin controllers.
In the future it is possible that I will add a globalization of the PluginSystem object but that could lead
to many security issues
